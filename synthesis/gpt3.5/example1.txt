prove that strings in python from input() end in a newline character

To prove that strings in Python obtained from `input()` end in a newline character, we can perform the following demonstration:

```python
# Prompt the user for input
user_input = input("Enter a string: ")

# Add a character 'x' at the end of the input string
user_input += 'x'

# Check if the last character is 'x'
if user_input[-1] == 'x':
    print("The string ends with 'x'")

# Check if the second-to-last character is a newline
if user_input[-2] == '\n':
    print("The string ends with a newline character")
```

If the input is given as 'Hello', the code will output:
```
The string ends with 'x'
```

This shows that the input string obtained from `input()` does not end with a newline character.
